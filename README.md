# Overwatch Eidolon update 
### Current Situation:

1. Component encryption has been removed.
2. Half of the components have been removed.
3. A new anti-cheat has been introduced.
4. Anti-injection measures have been added with the new anti-cheat.
5. Outline and visibility functions have been removed.
6. Components are now decrypted at runtime.


### What's Affected in Our Product:
1. Aimbot needs to be re-written.
2. Most visuals are non-functional.

The previous anti-cheat, **Warden**, has been replaced by **Eidolon**, the new anti-cheat system.

### Timeline for Twilight Update: 
We plan to proceed cautiously with updates due to the new anti-cheat. Our priority is to thoroughly test the product before it goes live again, as we want to ensure user safety and avoid any bans.

Thank you for your understanding as we take the necessary time to make these updates.
