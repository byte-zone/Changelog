# Upcoming Update for Twilight 1.9 & Annual Plan üéâ
_At Twilight, we believe ongoing development and open dialogue with our community are central to our success. We‚Äôre excited to share an overview of our upcoming update and our vision for 2025. We're also proud to announce that we've achieved all of our goals for 2024, and we remain focused on enhancing our products and services._

## API üîß
### New Endpoints & Security Improvements
_We've updated our backend to prepare for this major release. Our API now handles errors and user traffic with improved efficiency._
### Advanced Calculations & Performance
_Since Twilight operates on a server-side framework, user network speeds can impact performance, leading to potential lag. To address this, we‚Äôve refined and upgraded our logic to ensure the aimbot runs smoothly with minimal delay. However, Twilight is not fully server-dependent; for example, features like outline rendering are managed locally. For a more detailed overview, please refer to the image below._

## Drivers üñ•Ô∏è
#### TwsCore:
_Now includes kernel spoofing to minimize detection by programs like Vanguard. We also plan to sign all Twilight products, eliminating the need to disable Windows Defender, Secure Boot, or TPM._
#### **TwsSpoofer (Temp):** 
_Enhanced spoofing stability now includes NVMe Gen 4 & 5 and SIMBIOS support, Kernel-level improvements also provide better function hooking._
#### TwsDrv:
_Enhanced memory management, resolved BSOD issues, and optimized function hooking._
#### Twilight UEFI Spoofer:
_We are excited to introduce our new UEFI Spoofer designed for total unban capabilities. Unlike other spoofers that run as services at boot, ours requires only a one-time spoof. If you're concerned about your PC parts' warranty, changes are easily reversible. The UEFI Spoofer is in development and currently tested on Windows 10 21H2._

### Overall Improvements üìà
#### TwsCore: 
_Our kernel driver has been upgraded with features like `CallStack Spoofing, Stack Walking Spoofing, and Return Address spoofing from user and kernel modes.` Some of these features will remain private to ensure our users‚Äô security._
### Twilight Products üõ†Ô∏è
#### Twilight Client (OW Client):
_Improved security, streamlined auto-login, and enhanced product performance._
#### TwsMapper:
_Now connects to our servers for seamless updates, providing automatic updates for users._
#### Twilight Launcher (Public):
_Enhanced similarly to TwsMapper. Please note that RDR2 and Battlefield 1 are temporarily offline due to an impending BattleEye release for RDR2. EA also launched an update on October 10 that includes their new EAAC kernel driver. We‚Äôve paused support for BF1 and RDR2 to prevent any bans, as none of our users have reported bans due to our products._

### New Feature ‚ú®
_We're introducing a new Lua API, allowing for custom Lua scripts to adjust aimbot settings, entities, and more. This feature will integrate seamlessly with the config system and open up a marketplace for Lua developers to share and monetize their work._


### 2025 Plan üìÖ
_We‚Äôre passionate developers dedicated to our work and community. While our 2025 plan isn‚Äôt finalized, we look forward to sharing it with you soon._


#### Best regards,
##### _Byte Zone Developers_
