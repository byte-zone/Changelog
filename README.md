# Upcoming Update for Twilight 1.9 & Annual Plan üéâ
_At Twilight, we believe that continuous improvements and communication with our community are the keys to success. We want to prove that we are authentic developers who care about our community and we're excited to share with you our upcoming update and our annual plan for 2025. We are also pleased to announce that all our goals for 2024 have been achieved, and we aim to continue improving our products and services._

## API üîß
### New Endpoints & Security Improvements
_We have deployed an update to our backend, preparing our products for this significant update. Our API now handles errors and user traffic more effectively_
### Enhanced Mathematics & Calculations
_Most of our backend logic connects users to our server to manage calculations and stream data into the game efficiently_


## Drivers üñ•Ô∏è
#### TwsCore:
_Now includes kernel spoofing, making detection by programs like Vanguard more difficult. We also plan to sign all Twilight products so you won't need to disable Windows Defender or features like Secure Boot or TPM_
#### **TwsSpoofer (Temp):** 
_Improved spoofing capabilities for greater stability, now supporting NVMe Gen 4 & 5 and SIMBIOS. <If the SIMBIOS hasn't changed, please click here.> Improved function hooking through the kernel_
#### TwsDrv:
_Enhanced memory management, fixed BSOD issues, and improved function hooking_
#### Twilight UEFI Spoofer:
_As Twilight developers, we continuously strive for innovation. We are pleased to announce our new UEFI Spoofer, designed to unban everything. Unlike most permanent spoofers that change serials and run as services upon boot, our solution only requires a one-time spoof. Additionally, if you're concerned about your PC parts' warranty, you can easily undo all changes. The UEFI Spoofer is still under development and has only been tested on Windows 10 21H2_

### Overall Improvements üìà
#### TwsCore: 
_Our kernel driver has undergone many enhancements to execute our logic safely and prevent bans. New features include `CallStack Spoofing, Stack Walking Spoofing, Return Addresses from user mode and kernel mode`, and much more. We aim to keep some of these features private as they are vital to maintaining our users' and products' undetected status_
### Twilight Products üõ†Ô∏è
#### Twilight Client (OW Client):
_Security, auto-login, and application performance have been significantly improved_
#### TwsMapper:
_Now connects to our servers for easier updates, enabling automatic updates for users_
#### Twilight Launcher (Public):
_The launcher has received similar enhancements. Please note that RDR2 and Battlefield 1 are currently offline due to a planned BattleEye release for RDR2. EA has launched an update today, October 10, which includes their new EAAC kernel driver. For security reasons, we've paused both BF1 and RDR2 to prevent any bans, as NONE OF OUR USERS HAVE REPORTED BEING BANNED DUE TO OUR PRODUCTS_


### 2025 Plan üìÖ
_As mentioned earlier, we are serious developers who love our work and community. While we have not finalized our annual plan yet, we look forward to sharing it with our community soon_


#### Best regards,
##### _Byte Zone Developers_
